### `Project Overview:`

You all must have visited some or the other video streaming sites and this one
is no different(well in streaming services) but what makes it different is that it uses
blockchain, web3 and the concept of decentralization for everything and by everything we mean it!<br>
<br>
But what exactly makes it different from others and how exactly do we implement web3 and
blockchain like no other does?

### `How Gamoly works?`

Well Gamoly uses blockchain at its core. And this is done by implementing the
following technologies.<br><br>
1. First of all  the login page:
   - We use Arcana auth for authentications and logins (which basically creates
       a encryted address for the user) so all you need to do is to click
       a button and you are ready to go.<br>
   - It stores the credentials in a decentralized way so there is no chance of
       data leaks.
1. After you are logged in you can either choose to watch live streams or create
   one!
    - So if you chose to watch a stream you'll be presented by a video player
        which is is created with video.js and next js. All the data for the
        streams are managed by a smart contract.
    - If you chose to create a stream you will be greeted with a Create Stream
        where you'll be asked for the name of the stream page where you'll get your Stream Id, Stream Key, and        other credentials and after filling the details your stream will be ready to go live. Our streaming services are provided by livepeer, a decentralized video streaming network built on Ethereum blockchain. 
1. MarketPlace: Gamoly has an official marketplace where you can sell or buy the best
   streaming moments through videos and images. You can even resell them or have
   a full collection of your favorite streamers!
